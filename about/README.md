<h4> Hey there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verma-anushka/verma-anushka/master/gifs/wave.gif" width="30px"></h4>
<h6>On a snowy night in Torino, Italy, Dec. 6th 2020 AD (The covid years)</h6>
<br>
<h6>My hard-drive was almost full so I decided it was time to upload some of my photos somewhere. And here I am.</h6>
<h6>Before going digital I used a Nikon N6006 but, to be honest, my analogue photos are almost total rubbish.</h6>
<h6>I bought my first digital camera in 2006 (a D70s) and today I use a Nikon D800. My most precious lens is a Nikkor AF-S VR 300mm f2.8</h6>
<h6>I really like sport photography, especially MotoGP, especially Valentino Rossi.</h6>
<br>
<h6>Thank you for visiting my page, come back every now and then.</h6>
<h6>And please, judge tenderly of me.</h6>
<br>
<h6>Yours truly,</h6>
<h6>Gianpaolo</h6>
