<span style="color:white">Hey there! </span> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gianpaolof/gianpaolof.github.io/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
<br>
<span style="color:white">My hard-drive was almost full so I decided it was time to upload some of my photos somewhere. And here I am. </span>
<span style="color:white">Before going digital I used a Nikon N6006 but, to be honest, my analogue photos are almost total rubbish. </span>
<span style="color:white">I bought my first digital camera in 2006 (a D70s) and today I use a Nikon D800. My most precious lens is a Nikkor AF-S VR 300mm f2.8< </span>
<span style="color:white">I really like sport photography, especially MotoGP, especially Valentino Rossi. </span>
<br>
<span style="color:white">Thank you for visiting my page, come back every now and then. </span>
<span style="color:white">And please, judge tenderly of me. </span>
<br>
<span style="color:white">Yours truly, </span>
<span style="color:white">Gianpaolo< </span>
